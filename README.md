Battleground
============

Battleground is a plugin to add different mini-games to your Minecraft server. 
It serves as a parent plugin, where other developers will be able to easily develop a mini game and simply drop it into the battleground pluin folder.

This automatic integration is still being developed and the plugin is still in very early, unstable stages of development.

If you want to follow development, just follow the project or follow me on twitter (@TheMoreYouSnow).
